## Introduction
The Stock Analysis Tool is a Python script that provides functionalities to analyze historical stock price data. It retrieves stock data using the Yahoo Finance API, visualizes the stock's price movements using candlestick charts, determines the overall trend of the stock based on linear regression analysis, and performs trend analysis to assist users in making informed investment decisions.

## What is Stock Analysis Tool?
The Stock Analysis Tool is designed to help users gain insights into a stock's price movements and trends over a specific time period. It utilizes several Python libraries, including pandas, NumPy, mplfinance, yfinance, scikit-learn, and Plotly, to perform various analysis tasks.

## What is Trend Analysis?
Trend analysis is a fundamental aspect of stock market analysis used to identify and analyze the overall direction or trend of a stock's price movement over a specific period. The primary goal of trend analysis is to predict the future movement of a stock based on historical price data. Key points related to trend analysis include:

- **Upward Trend**: An upward trend, also known as a bullish trend, occurs when a stock's price consistently increases over time. In an upward trend, higher highs and higher lows are typically observed on price charts.

- **Downward Trend**: A downward trend, also known as a bearish trend, occurs when a stock's price consistently decreases over time. In a downward trend, lower lows and lower highs are typically observed on price charts.

- **Sideways Trend**: A sideways trend, also known as a neutral trend or a range-bound trend, occurs when a stock's price moves within a relatively narrow price range over time. In a sideways trend, the stock's price neither significantly increases nor decreases.

- **Trend Confirmation**: Trend analysis often involves the use of technical indicators and statistical tools to confirm the presence of a particular trend. Linear regression is one such tool used in this Stock Analysis Tool to determine the trend based on the slope of the regression line.

- **Trading Decisions**: Trend analysis is crucial for making informed trading decisions. Traders and investors may choose to go long (buy) during an upward trend, go short (sell) during a downward trend, or use other strategies during a sideways trend.

The Stock Analysis Tool provides the functionality to determine the trend of a stock based on linear regression analysis and categorizes the trend as 'upward', 'downward', or 'sideways' based on the slope of the regression line.

## Installation
To use the Stock Analysis Tool, you will need Python and the required libraries installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install Python: Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install necessary libraries: Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:
   ```
   pip install pandas
   pip install numpy
   pip install mplfinance
   pip install yfinance
   pip install matplotlib
   pip install plotly
   ```

## Usage
1. Import the required libraries and the `Stock Analysis Tool` code into your Python script.

2. Define the ticker symbol of the stock for which you want to perform analysis.

3. Specify the start and end dates for the historical data you want to retrieve.

4. Use the `get_stock_data` function provided in the `Stock Analysis Tool` to fetch historical stock price data. The function returns a DataFrame containing columns for 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Close' prices.

5. Utilize the `plot_candlestick_chart` function to visualize the stock's price movements using a candlestick chart created with Plotly.

6. Determine the overall trend of the stock using the `get_trend` function, which fits a linear regression model to the closing price data and categorizes the trend as 'upward', 'downward', or 'sideways' based on the slope of the regression line.
